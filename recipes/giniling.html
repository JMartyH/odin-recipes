        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pork Giniling is a pork dish that makes use of ground pork as the primary ingredient. Ground pork is stewed in tomato sauce and water to bring out the taste while vegetables such as carrots and potatoes (some also like this with raisins and green peas) are added for additional flavor and nutrition.</p>
        
        <p>This can be considered as a staple dish in the Philippines when ground pork is concerned. I think that it is fair to say that Filipinos are into pork giniling as much as Americans are into chili. I have 2 ways of preparing this dish, this is the first while the other makes use of guisantes or green peas and raisins – boiled eggs are out of the picture.</p>
